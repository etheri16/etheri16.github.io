<h1> Technology Research Paper </h1>
The technology company I choose to talk about is called, “Scholly”.  Basically Scholly is an easy way to find scholarships  for high school seniors, current graduates and graduate students. Scholly is a web based app that allows you to search and find scholarships to help you through out your academic career. Millions of dollars or scholarship money go unclaimed because students font know how to find the money or its to hard to find the scholarships. What interest me about this idea is that while I was scrolling down the website you gave us https://www.crunchbase.com, it stuck out to me because I remember I seen it a couple of days ago while I was watching a television, it was a show called “shark tank” . One of the founders Christopher gray went n the tv show describing the app and how it works, to try to find investors for this app he and 2 other people created. At the end of his discussion he got 2 investors to invest 40 thousand each for 15% of the company. Christopher went on the show and basically explained that he was a Drexel University junior who by using this app he and his two co-founders created he has won over 1.3 million dollars in scholarship money, thats a lot of money. The two other co founders are Nick Pirollo who is an avid developer and entrepreneur who specializes in iOs, android and web development. The other is Bryon Alef who is an entrepreneur /computer scientist, an expert in mobile application development and technology. 

A little about the app, Scholly use’s several different specific parameters such as, race, state, major, GPA  to filter scholarships you are eligible for . Whats great about this application is how easiest it is, at he palm of your hands you have several chances search, sign up, email your applications to win, hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars. This app is quick and this app is new, thats what the people want, it provides a medium that websites can’t offer. Another detail it doesn't ask for all your personal information such as , home address or social security number which wastes time,so by cutting a lot things out of the search process it becomes a very intuitive interface.The apps database is updated monthly to add more and more scholarships , remove scholarships and refresh deadlines. So far Schools has over 100,000 downloads in the app store and it can be bought for the low price of .99cents. So look at it like this “Pay 99 cents and you may get a $5000 dollars in scholarship money.

The technology aspect of the application, the application right now requires iOS 6.0 or later, its compatible with iPhone, iPad, IPod Touch on iTunes, it is also available on the android market and also through the Google market.  Scholly uses an algorithm to configure what apps each person gets when they enter their information and search for the scholarship. Unfortunately a description of Scholly database and software is not available to the public because the website has a “robot.Txt.” 
	“A robots.Txt file is a file at the root of your site that indicates those parts of your site you don’t want accessed by search engine crawlers. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, which is a protocol with a small set of commands that can be used to indicate access to your site by section and by specific kinds of web crawlers (such as mobile crawlers vs desktop crawlers).”

From reading the different articles and watching the video, I have configured that Scholly uses a specific algorithm that they use in their scholarship database to figure out which scholarships are best for you. Kind of upset they don’t give more info on the software or database.
